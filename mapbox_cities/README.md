May need to run a local server to see this working in a browser

with python 3, cd into this folder and then run `python3 -m http.server` . This is the command on mac, but there are many other ways to do this as well.

With python2 run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` .

Once the command is run, open the browser and navigate to localhost:8000 (unless you have your python configured to a different port)
